# RTES_Autonomous_Car_Braking_System

Working Principle: The primary objective of our project ‘Autonomous Car Braking System’ is to use OpenCv Object Detection tool on the Raspberry Pi interfaced with Rpi Camera for detecting road signs and regulating the car speed

The project will be primarily divided into two real time services which are
1. Image Processing using OpenCV 
2. Car Motor Speed Regulation 

Following are the Hardware Components which we will be incorporating in our project 
1) Raspberry Pi 3  
2) Raspberry Pi Camera  
3) Motor Driver & Motors
